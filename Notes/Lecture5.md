## Lecture Five Material
OpenCL arise with the intersection of parallelism between CPUs and GPUs. Leverage any
device to accelerate computation. Portabilitiy across devices/architectures.

Provides low-level abstract for "expert developers", with hig-performance and device
portability. 

OpenCL is a ISO C99 with languange extensions. Static or dynamic compilation of
kernels. Biult-in extenstions are includes.
