## Lecture Three Material
Intel Thread Building Block ( TBB )

##### Limitation of multicore programming 
Requires more then threading, requires expertise for correctness and performance
- code must be written with threads in mind
- syncronization makes theprogram more complex
- fixed to the hardware developed on ( over or under subcribe  hardware scalabilty when porting app)

### TBB
- Task pattern parallelism
- robust performance
- compatability ( multi os )
- program scalabilty
- provides synchronization object and shared objects

##### Parallel Algorithms
